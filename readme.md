This tool makes use of [ImageMagick's](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) 'convert.exe'. For optimal results, infiles should already have an equally squared aspect ratio. Due to how this tool works, the sizes of the various icons within the group are forced into predetermined dimensions. Icons **must** be squared in both aspect ratio and dimensions. The infile should be no larger than 256 x 256 (px) in resolution, larger images can be used but conversion will take longer. Once a file is converted, it will be output to the same location as the infile and will have the same file label.

Icon groups are made with the following sizes of icons:

- 256
- 128
- 96
- 54
- 48
- 32
- 24
- 16
